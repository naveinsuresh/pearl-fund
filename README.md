# Portfolio Optimization

This repository aims to leverage advanced financial economics & statistics concepts to construct an optimized portfolio of risky and risk-free assets for a client, adjustable to their risk-tolerance levels. We make use of ideas from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMF). Please note that this is a developing project — we plan on utilizing econometric principles such as time series analysis and forecasting to generate positive alpha trading strategies for our portfolio.

All work is done through R and excel, powered by tidyverse packages & optimization packages — tidyquant & ROI.

A big thanks to Berkeley Professors, Dr. Gaston Sanchez & Dr. Stephen Bianchi for mentoring & sharing their valuable insights along the way. Please look through the repository and give it a try yourself. Feel free to reach out with any questions or insights!

Cheers!
